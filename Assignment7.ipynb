Abstraction focuses on hiding implementation details and exposing only essential \n# features, such as defining abstract methods in a Shape class for area and perimeter without detailing their calculations. Encapsulation, on the other hand, bundles\n# data and methods into a single unit and restricts access to protect data, like a BankAccount class hiding its balance as a private variable accessed only through \n# controlled methods like deposit and withdraw. While abstraction deals with \"what\" a system does, encapsulation ensures \"how\" its data is accessed and protected.",
